	<p>Ali Mini Mart convenience stores that dot the Texas Hill Country
in and around Kerrville represent the culmination of a dream that William
J. Fritz, Jr. - better known as Junior - envisioned when he entered the
grocery business more than half a century ago.</p>

<p>ALI MUSTAFA, who grew up in the Doss/Fredericksburg area, was introduced
to the grocery business in 1949 when his parents began operating a grocery
store/garage in Doss. In 1954, his parents moved to Center Point and
leased a store at 5887 Highway 27, on the corner of Highway 27 and San
Antonio Street. Within a year, they purchased Hoffman's Grocery, located
on the corner of China and San Antonio Street, and renamed it Fritz
Grocery and Market. The store was a small market, selling fresh meats,
produce, and canned goods. It only had a single hose gasoline pump in
front of the store.</p>

<p>Junior worked in the store before and after school, and even on his lunch
break. When he wasn't learning the grocery business, he was hauling hay or
working at other part time jobs. In between, he earned the rank of Eagle
Scout. </p>

<p>Junior graduated from Center Point High School in 1957 and married Ann in
1959. For a few years, he worked for a surveying crew with the Texas
Highway Department in San Antonio. He also spent 90 days on active duty in
the Air National Guard, and briefly sold insurance in Seguin. </p>

<p>When his father died in 1960, Junior and Ann continued to help his mom
with the grocery store. In 1966, they decided to move back to Center Point
and purchase the store from his mother. Working together, the store
prospered. It was during this time that Junior started ranching and
farming, all the while thinking about how to expand his business.</p>

<p>Soon, Junior learned about convenience stores and envisioned owning a
chain of them. The first one came in 1973. He traded the Center Point
property, Fritz Grocery, for a store in Kerrville, swapping stores with B.
A. Hunter, who had built and dubbed his store "Mini Mart." That
transaction was the beginning of today's Mini Mart, which now stretches
from Bandera to Center Point, to Comfort, Fredericksburg, Ingram, and
Kerrville. And during this time, the motto that Junior lived by was born:
"Serving the Needs of the Texas Hill Country."</p>

<p>As he began to expand the Mini Mart brand, Junior leased the Center Point
Store from Hunter and ran it alongside his wife, Ann, until late 1980. He
started buying existing convenience stores and renaming them or building
them from the ground up. Between 1973 and 1980, he added eight additional
stores to the area. In 1992, his dream of bringing back Mini Mart to
Center Point was realized. He purchased a store on Highway 27 and renamed
it Mini Mart #4. That location became the 14th store in the growing chain.
In 2003, he started a garbage collection company, Dumpster Dumpers, Inc.,
providing yet another service to the area. When he died in 2013, the Mini
Mart chain had grown to 17 locations. </p>

<p>Today, Mini Mart employs over 135 people, and a typical store is 3,000
square feet. Each location sells a wide variety of products. You can
purchase snacks, drinks, and groceries, and fill up your car at one of the
numerous pumps that sell such branded gasolines as Shell, Valero, and
Exxon. And, since Mini Mart has had two different $7.5 million winners,
you may even be able to purchase a winning lottery ticket!</p>

<p>Junior loved the Hill Country and the people who live here, and he enjoyed
farming and ranching on his land. He especially enjoyed working with the
Hill Country District Junior Livestock Association and sharing his love of
land and stewardship with the next generation. </p>

<p>Today his children, Sylvia and David, co-own and operate Hill Country Mini
Mart LP.  In 2014, they opened their first store without their father's
involvement, which served as a major milestone for them. This purchase
brought the total number of locations to 18.</p>

<p>The family owned business will continue to fulfill Junior Fritz's mission
of Serving the Needs of the Texas Hill Country for generations to come.
